This is a simple JavaFX app that simulates the Moiré patterns from Numberphile's "Freaky dot patterns" video, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAja2jp1VjE.

Two identical images are shown. The bottom one is fixed in position, the other one lies above it. The above image may be transformed in order to create a Moiré pattern. The transformation applied is affine and so its rotation, translation (x, y) and scaling (common or x, y separately) can be changed.

In the "image setup" section the image may be customized, for example the image may contain random pixels or a regular pattern. The foreground and background color of the image can be changed.
