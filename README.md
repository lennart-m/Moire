This is a simple JavaFX app that simulates the Moiré patterns from Numberphile's "Freaky dot patterns" video, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAja2jp1VjE.

Different types of images can be created, for example random pixels, or a checkerboard pattern. One copy of a selected image is fixed on the screen, another one can be transformed in order to create a Moiré effect.
